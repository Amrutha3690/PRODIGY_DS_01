Task 01: Visualizing Data Distribution:
Description:
For this task, I was assigned to create a **bar chart or histogram** to visualize the distribution of a **categorical or continuous variable**.  
I chose to work with **world population data** to demonstrate my ability to handle and visualize both categorical and continuous data effectively using Python and data visualization libraries.

Dataset:
**Dataset Source:** World Bank population dataset (cleaned version)  
This dataset includes population values for each country from 1960 to 2022.

Variable Selection:
- **Categorical View:** Country Name  
- **Continuous View:** Population values  
- **Year Selected for Analysis:** 2022

Data Analysis in Python (Google Colab):
Bar Chart – Top 10 Most Populous Countries (Categorical Distribution):
- Filtered the data for the year 2022  
- Sorted countries by population in descending order  
- Plotted the top 10 countries using a horizontal bar chart with Seaborn

Histogram – Distribution of All Country Populations (Continuous Distribution):
- To better understand the distribution and skewness of population sizes, I used a **log-scaled histogram**

Output:
- The **bar chart** highlights the countries with the highest populations, showing clear differences between the top 10.  
- The **histogram** (with log scale) shows how most countries have smaller populations, while a few have extremely large populations (e.g., China, India).

Impact: 
- Data Understanding:
Revealed global population disparities and highlighted which countries dominate population statistics.
- Visualization Skills:
Demonstrated ability to use Python libraries to create clean, meaningful visuals using bar charts and histograms.
- Analytical Thinking:
Reinforced my ability to select appropriate visualization methods based on data type (categorical vs continuous) and distribution characteristics.
